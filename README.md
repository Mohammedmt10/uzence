# Uzence
Run this to clone the repo :  
``` git clone https://github.com/Mohammedmt10/uzence.git ```<br><br>

Then to run it locally run :<br>
``` npm run storybook ```<br><br>

Approach : <br>
   - I first made the Input Field since i have already worked on similar ui Component earlier while learning. <br>
   - For DataTable I refer to primereact docs for working and then the interface also helped a lot<br>
   - For storybook since i never used it and due to time constraints i had to use ai for setting up the storybook syntax and then when I get how it works it was easy<br>
   - I have already uploaded through vercel so that was not an issue and thus the project was done.
